==== Provisioning Physical Servers

Physical servers can be provisioned using Lenovo XClarity Administrator (LXCA) configuration patterns. A configuration pattern can be thought of as a template that describes the configuration of servers. The Lenovo Physical Infrastructure Provider discovers configuration patterns that are defined on the LXCA instance that's associated with the provider. A pattern can then be applied to a single or multiple physical servers.
